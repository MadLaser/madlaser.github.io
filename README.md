# Secret Santa Wild

First, you have to pick a random name from your fellow wilders. The name should remain secret until the end (it's a **secret** santa ;-)

You should modify/custom the index.html to create the most beautiful and fun page. It will be your gift to the name you have picked.

## INSTRUCTIONS
- Clone the repository.
- Change the wilder's name in the `<h1>`
- You should work only with the 2 files *index.html* and *style.css*. It would be **pure HTML/CSS** only (no PHP nor JS, be creative !)
- you can add HTML to the index.html page, but you must keep a "one page format". We should see all the work **without any scrolling**. 
- once you have finished, publish your work with github pages !
